// The Relay Flow enables communication between a target webpage and a background service worker using a lightweight message handler called a relay.
// This relay is registered with the relayMessage function in a content script.

// The relayMessage function abstracts the window.postMessage mechanism,
// registering a listener that checks for messages matching the same origin and forwards them to the background service worker.
// These messages are then processed by the appropriate message flow handlers registered under background/messages.

// The sendToBackgroundViaRelay function sends messages through the relay and waits for a response.
// It generates a unique instance ID for each message to ensure proper handling and response tracking.

// You may view the implementation of these functions in the GitHub repository(opens in a new tab).

// This method provides an alternative to the "externally_connectable"(opens in a new tab) method described in the Chrome extension documentation.

// Setting Up a Relay
// To set up a relay, use the relayMessage function in a content script.
// A content script can have multiple relays.
// Given the ping message handler from the previous example, and the website www.plasmo.com:
